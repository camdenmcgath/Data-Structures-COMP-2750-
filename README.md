- Chapter 4 Delimeter Matching
    - Utilizes a stack
    - Using command line arguments, user can check a .cpp file's delimeters to make sure they match
- Chapter 5 Raster Recursion
    - Utilizes a backtracing recursive function 
    - Program takes in a grid of characters 't' and 'g' (tree and grass) that emulates a raster
    - Then the recursive function identifies and lables clusters of trees in the raster
