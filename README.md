# Data Structures
This is a compilation of projects written for the Data Structures COMP-2750 course in FA22 semester at Northwest Nazarene University. They are all written in C++ and focus on specializing and utilizing essential data structures and algorithms.
## Projects
- Chapter 3 Airline Tickets
    - Utlizes a custom made doubly linked list
    - Program allows for reserving, changing, and deleting flight       reservations
- Chapter 4 Delimeter Matching
    - Utilizes a stack
    - Using command line arguments, user can check a .cpp file's delimeters to make sure they match
- Chapter 5 Raster Recursion
    - Utilizes a backtracing recursive function 
    - Program takes in a grid of characters 't' and 'g' (tree and grass) that emulates a raster
    - Then the recursive function identifies and lables clusters of trees in the raster
    - Uses command line arguments to specify raster input and output to console or file
    - Identifies if a burned pixel is too small and thus a shadow
    - Identifies if tree cluster is completely surrounded by burned pixels and no grass pixels. If so, entire burned island pixels are changed to burn on output
- Chapter 6 Verse Numbers
    - CLI that outputs a cross reference given a text file input of a Bible verse
    - Uses a generic Binary Search Tree to keep track of words
- Chapter 9 Big Heap Sort
    - CLI that prints either an ascending or decending list of integers using a heap sort
    - Uses either a max or min heap depending on CLI arguments
